# Functions
When we wrote `int main() {}` we defined the main function. Let's define other ones.
### Structuing code in a more useful way...
Instead of putting all our code in the main function we can move it to an other function (outside of main):
```cpp
double average(std::vector<double> vec) {
    
}
